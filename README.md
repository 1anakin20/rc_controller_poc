# RC Controller Android App PoC
Proof of concept applicationt to control an RC car using [pi-rc](https://github.com/1anakin20/pi-rc).
As being a simple example of what it is possible, the parameters for my specific car were hard coded in.
If you want to use it with a different one, you may have to modify the source code.
